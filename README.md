What is a figma plugin?<br/>
Plugins are programs or applications created by the community that extend the functionality of Figma and FigJam. Plugins run in Figma or FigJam files and perform one or more user actions. They allow users to customize their experience or create more efficient workflows.<br/>
Here are some of the useful figma plugins:

1) REMOVE BG :<br/>
Images are a crucial and important part of any UI/UX design. Sometimes their backgrounds can make our design feel off, clutterd and ultimately drive attention away from where it is needed. Photo editors can be used to manually remove the background of the images, but that can take up a lot of our time especially when we are working with multiple images. This is where the Remove Bg plugin comes in handy. <br/> 
Remove Bg plugin can handle the job in seconds. It works by using artificial intelligence to identify the main object within an image and cuts out the rest. This tool is a great time saver and must be tried out once.<br/>

2) UNSPLASH:<br/>
Visuals play a vital role in UI/UX designing. They can enhacne the overall look of our interface, grab the user's attention and provide context to the rest of our content. Manually seaching for stock photography websites, dowloading images and adding them to our design can be cumbersome and time consuming. This is where the unsplash plugin makes our task easier. <br/>
Unsplash is a royalty-free image gallery that we can use even without exiting our screen. Unsplash has thousands of images submitted by the public community, so no matter what we are designing, unsplash will surely provide us with some images. All we have to do is open up the plugin and search for the keyword and now we have multiple images to choose from. 
Unsplash's images files usually occupy less than one MB of space, so we don't have to worry about performance too much.  Thus, this plugin is convinient and also comes free of charge.  <br/>

3) FONT PREVIEW: <br/>
Along with visuals, fonts are another essential element in UI/UX designing. Users will pay more attention to written content as the information is mainly transmitted through texts.
Thus, the fonts have to be appealing and easy to read. Furthermore, fonts help us to set the tone and voice for our content, enabling us to convey a stronger message and evoke specific emotions. Also, the fonts we choose have to go along with the rest of our design. Otherwise, our interface might look off-putting.
In other words, there's a lot to look out for when picking the correct fonts. Although Figma comes with most of the Google fonts preinstalled, sifting through them can be a nightmare because we'll never know precisely how each font will look like once we apply it to your design. This is where the plugin Font Preview finds it's use.<br/> 
Font Preview allows us to see how our text would look like in different fonts within the plugin window. Not only that, but we can also save our favorites in a separate tab, so we can quickly access them. Thus, this plugin makes our work more efficient and saves our time.<br/>
