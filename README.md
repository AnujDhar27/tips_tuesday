What is a figma plugin?
Plugins are programs or applications created by the community that extend the functionality of Figma and FigJam. Plugins run in Figma or FigJam files and perform one or more user actions. They allow users to customize their experience or create more efficient workflows.
Here are some of the useful figma plugins:

1) REMOVE BG :
Images are a crucial and important part of any UI/UX design. Sometimes their backgrounds can make your design feel off, clutterd and ultimately drive attention away from where it is needed. 
Photo editors can be used to manually remove the background of the images, but that can take up a lot of our time especially when we are working with multiple images. This is where the Remove Bg plugin comes in handy. It can handle the job in seconds. It works by using artificial intelligence to identify the main object within an image and cut out the rest. This tool is a great time saver and must be tried out once.
